<p>We hope you have already learned how to write simple Python programs consisting of a single line that just prints a text. However, real programs contain a significant number of lines: from tens and hundreds for small scripts to thousands and even more for large projects. So, in this lesson, you will write programs that print multiple lines.</p>
<h5 id="ways-of-printing-multiple-lines">Ways of printing multiple lines</h5>
<p>Let's consider an example, the following code prints exactly three strings, each on a new line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print("I")
print("know")
print("Python")</code></pre>
<p>The output is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">I
know
Python</code></pre>
<p>You can run this example <a href="https://repl.it/languages/python3" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Link: https://repl.it/languages/python3">here</a> or locally if you have already installed Python on your computer.</p>
<p>There are other ways to print the same text using just one function call. We will consider them in the next topics.</p>
<p>The <code class="language-python">print</code> function also allows you to print an empty line with no string specified:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print("I")
print()
print("know")
print()
print("Python")</code></pre>
<p>Here's the output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">I

know

Python</code></pre>
<p>However, skipping the line will have no effect:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print("And")

print("you?")</code></pre>
<p>The output is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">And
you?</code></pre>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>In this short lesson, we learned how to deal with multiple lines with the help of <code class="language-python">print()</code>. Now it's time to solve some problems.</p></body></html>
